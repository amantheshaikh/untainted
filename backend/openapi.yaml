    # Getting Started
    Welcome to the Untainted API. This API provides a robust **food intelligence layer** for platforms, enabling quick-commerce, grocery, and health apps to deliver personalized safety checks for millions of users.

    The API is designed to be simple to use, with predictable resource-oriented URLs and standard HTTP response codes.

    ## Authentication
    This API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the [Untainted Dashboard](https://untainted.io/dashboard).

    Authentication to the API is performed via HTTP Header. Provide your API key as the value for the `x-api-key` header.

    ```bash
    curl -H "x-api-key: sk_live_..." https://api.untainted.io/check
    ```

    > **Security Note:** Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, etc.

    ### Key Variants
    Keys come in two variants:
    - **Live (`sk_live_...`)**: Production environment. Hits are billed and affect actual data.
    - **Test (`sk_test_...`)**: Sandbox environment. Use these for development and testing integration without affecting production stats.

    ## Core Concepts

    ### Safety Checks
    The `/check` endpoint is the heart of Untainted. It determines if a product is "safe" or "not_safe" for a specific customer based on their unique profile (diets, allergies, health goals).

    **Workflow:**
    1.  **Identify**: You send a product's ingredient list (OCR'd or from database).
    2.  **Contextualize**: You provide the customer's specific profile (passed as preferences object or via `customer_uid`).
    3.  **Decide**: We return a binary `status` ("safe" | "not_safe") along with detailed categories and conflict explanations.

    ### Product Contribution
    We maintain a comprehensive database, but the food world is vast. We encourage partners to contribute missing data.
    
    **Workflow:**
    1.  Call `/product/lookup`.
    2.  If `404`, call `/product/missing` to submit the data.
    3.  We validate and merge it into the master dataset.
