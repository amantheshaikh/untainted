## The "Clean" Trap

Walk into a supermarket, and you'll see the word everywhere. "Clean ingredients." "Clean eating." "Clean label."

But what does it actually mean?

Legally? **Nothing.**
Culturally? It usually means "free from artificial stuff."
Biologically? It's a dangerous oversimplification.

<Callout type="warning" title="Consumer Confusion">
  According to recent surveys, nearly **50% of consumers** are confused by what "clean label" actually means, often conflating it with "organic" or "natural" despite those being distinct regulatory terms.
</Callout>

## Context is Everything

To a devout **Vegan**, a "clean" salad might be perfect. But to someone with **IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome)** on a Low-FODMAP diet, that same salad (full of onions and garlic) is a nightmare.

To a **Paleo** eater, a steak is "clean." To a **Jain**, it is spiritually completely forbidden.

To a parent of a child with **Celiac Disease**, a "clean" artisanal sourdough bread is a hospital visit waiting to happen.

## The Problem with Binary Labels

The food industry loves binaries. Good/Bad. Clean/Dirty. Toxic/Safe. But biology is not binary. It is highly individual.

-   **Gluten**: Fine for 99% of people, but poison for the 1% with Celiac Disease.
-   **Peanuts**: A protein-rich superfood for many, but deadly for others.
-   **Dairy**: A staple for Northern Europeans, but indigestible for **65% of the global population** due to lactose intolerance ([Source: NIH](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/lactose-intolerance)).

## Moving to "Compatibility"

We need to stop talking about "Clean Food" and start talking about **"Compatible Food."**

"Is this clean?" is the wrong question.
"Is this right *for me*?" is the only question that matters.

Untainted builds infrastructure for *compatibility*, not morality. We don't judge ingredients as "good" or "bad." We judge them as "matches" or "mismatches" against a specific human profile.
