## What is an Ultra-Processed Food?

You've heard the term. But what counts?
Is a can of beans processed? Yes.
Is a protein bar processed? Yes.
Are they the same? **Absolutely not.**

The **NOVA classification system**, developed by researchers at the University of São Paulo, splits food into four groups. The most dangerous is Group 4: **Ultra-Processed Foods (UPFs)**.

## The NOVA Groups

1.  **Group 1: Unprocessed / Minimally Processed** (Apples, milk, frozen broccoli).
2.  **Group 2: Processed Culinary Ingredients** (Butter, sugar, oil).
3.  **Group 3: Processed Foods** (Fresh bread, canned beans, cheese).
4.  **Group 4: Ultra-Processed Foods (UPFs)** (Soda, snacks, reconstituted meat).

## The Kitchen Test

**The Rule of Thumb:** If the ingredient list contains items you cannot buy for your own kitchen (e.g., "high-fructose corn syrup", "hydrolysed protein", "invert sugar"), it is likely Ultra-Processed.

## Why transparency matters

UPFs are transparently engineered to be hyper-palatable—bypassing your body's "fullness" signals.
Labels often hide this processing level behind "clean" sounding names. A "Healthy Granola Bar" might contain **Maltodextrin** (texturizer) and **Soy Lecithin** (emulsifier).
