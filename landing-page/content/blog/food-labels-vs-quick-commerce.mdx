## The Physical to Digital Loss

Food packaging is a masterpiece of information hierarchy—refined over 50 years of retail.
-   **Front**: Brand, Desire, Key Claims.
-   **Back**: Truth, Facts, Warnings.

You instinctively know to **turn the package around** to check the truth.

## The "Swipe" Problem

In a Quick Commerce app (Blinkit, Zepto, Instacart), there is no "back."
There is a carousel of images.
-   Image 1: Front of pack (High Res).
-   Image 2: Lifestyle shot (Product in a bowl).
-   Image 3: Zoomed in text (Often blurry).

**90% of users never swipe to Image 3.** They make a purchase decision based on Image 1 (Brand/Desire) and the Title.

  A 2023 study found that **over 50% of food products sold online** failed to display the allergen warnings present on physical packaging, creating a "Wild West" of safety risks.

## The Liability Gap

Who is responsible when a customer has an anaphylactic reaction to a product bought on an app, where the warning was missing?
Regulations like **Natasha's Law** (UK) mandated full disclosure for pre-packed foods, but the digital storefront is often specifically exempted or overlooked in older laws.

## Speed Kills (Caution)

Quick commerce is designed for **frictionless conversion**.
"Add to Cart" -> "Swipe to Pay" in 30 seconds.
Reading a label is **friction**. It slows you down. It makes you reconsider. So, apps (unintentionally) minimize it.

## The Solution: Active Interception

We cannot rely on users to "swipe to the 4th image and pinch-to-zoom on the ingredient list." That is a failed UX pattern.

We need **Active Interception**.
The app needs to know: "Aman is allergic to Peanuts."
When Aman adds that chocolate bar, the *App itself* must verify the backend data. If there's a risk, it must **interrupt** the flow.

> "Stop. This item has a high risk of peanuts."
