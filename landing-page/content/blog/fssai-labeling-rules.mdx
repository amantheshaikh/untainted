## The Green Dot Revolution

The **FSSAI (Food Safety and Standards Authority of India)** gave us one of the best labeling innovations in the world: **The Green/Red/Brown Dot.**

At a glance, any Indian consumer knows if a product is Veg or Non-Veg. This is superior to almost any labeling system in the West.

## What FSSAI Protects You From

In the **Food Safety and Standards (Labelling and Display) Regulations, 2020**, the mandate was strengthened:
1.  **Mandatory Declaration**: "Total Sugars" and "Added Sugars" must now be displayed ([Source: FSSAI](https://www.fssai.gov.in/)).
2.  **Allergen Info**: Contains Milk, Soy, Nuts, etc., must be declared.

## The Gaps (What They Don't Tell You)

### 1. The "Sugar" Hiding Game
FSSAI requires listing ingredients by weight. So brands split sugar into 3 types: *Sugar, Liquid Glucose, Dextrose.*
Individually, they are small, so they sit lower on the list. Combined, they might be the #1 ingredient.

### 2. "Class II Preservatives"
You'll often see "Contains Class II Preservatives."
This refers to a category in the **Food Safety and Standards Regulations** (e.g., Benzoates, Sulphites, Sorbates).
But which one? For someone with **Asthma**, knowing if it is a *Sulfite* specifically is critical. The "Class II" grouping obscures this.

### 3. Allergen Bold-ing
Unlike the EU/UK, where allergens MUST be **bolded** in the ingredient list, consistent enforcement in India is still catching up. You often have to hunt for "Contains Milk" in tiny font.

## Be Your Own Regulator

FSSAI sets the **floor**. As a consumer, you need to set your own **ceiling**.
Don't trust the front-of-pack claims ("Immunity Booster!", "Real Fruit!").
Flip the pack. Read the fine print.
