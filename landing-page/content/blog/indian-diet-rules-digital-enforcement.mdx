## The Complexity of "Veg"

In the West, "Vegetarian" usually just means "No Meat."
In India, "Veg" is a religion, a caste marker, and a way of life—with a dozen variations.

According to **Pew Research Center**, **39% of Indian adults** describe themselves as vegetarian. However, a staggering **81% limit meat** in some way (e.g., no beef, no pork, or only on certain days) ([Source: Pew Research](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2021/06/29/religion-and-food/)).

### The Spectrum
1.  **Eggetarian**: Eats eggs, no meat.
2.  **Pure Veg (Lacto-Vegetarian)**: No eggs, eats dairy.
3.  **Vegan**: No animal products at all (No dairy, no honey).
4.  **Jain**: No meat, no eggs, no root vegetables (onion, garlic, potato, carrot). **92% of Jains** follow a strict vegetarian diet ([Source: Pew](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2021/06/29/religion-and-food/)).
5.  **Sattvic**: Similar to Jain/Veg but also excludes stimulants like caffeine and chilies.

## The Digital Failure

Most global food APIs (like OpenFoodFacts or USDA) have a simple `is_vegetarian` boolean. This fails in India immediately.

-   **Case 1: The Egg Problem.**
    A cake marked "Vegetarian" in Europe often contains eggs. In India, that requires a **Red Dot** (Non-Veg), while eggless is **Green Dot**. Imported goods frequently confuse this, adhering to EU standards but violating Indian cultural expectations.

-   **Case 2: The Jain Nightmare.**
    "Natural Flavors" often contain onion powder. A product looks Veg but breaks Jain vows.
    Ordering a "Veg Burger" on an app? If the sauce contains garlic, it is *not* Jain-compliant. Most delivery apps don't track ingredients at this granularity.

-   **Case 3: Cross-Contamination.**
    "Veg" food cooked in the same oil as "Non-Veg" food. For many strict vegetarians, this renders the food inedible.

## Building for the Indian Context

To solve this, Untainted treats Indian diets not as simple "tags" but as **exclusion lists**.
A **Jain Profile** isn't just `Tag: Jain`. It is:
`Exclude: [Meat, Egg, Seafood, Onion, Garlic, Potato, Carrot, ...]`

We scan ingredient sub-lists for hidden root vegetables. We flag "E120 (Carmine)" as non-veg because it is derived from crushed insects.

India's dietary complexity is a feature, not a bug. Our software needs to respect that.
