## The "No Preservatives" Myth

We all want fresh food. But we also want food that doesn't rot in 24 hours. Enter preservatives.

While the wellness world demonizes all of them, many are harmless—or even essential for preventing botulism and deadly bacteria.

## The Good, The Bad, and The Misunderstood

### 1. The Ancient Preservatives (Safe)
*Salt, Sugar, Vinegar (Acetic Acid), Lemon Juice (Citric Acid - E330).*
These have been used for thousands of years. Just because it has an E-number (E330) doesn't make it toxic. It's just lemon juice.

### 2. The Necessary Evils (Use with Caution)
*Sodium Benzoate (E211), Potassium Sorbate (E202).*
Common in sauces and sodas. Generally recognized as safe in small amounts, researchers have noted potential links to hyperactivity in children when combined with certain artificial dyes ([Source: Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(07)61306-3/fulltext)).

### 3. The Ones to Watch (Avoid if Possible)
*Nitrates/Nitrites (E249-E252).*
Found in cured meats (bacon, salami). The **European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)** re-evaluated these in 2017 and maintained safe limits, but noted high exposure concerns for children. When cooked at high heat, they can form nitrosamines, which are potentially carcinogenic ([Source: EFSA](https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/170615)).

*BHA/BHT (E320, E321).*
Antioxidants used to keep fats from going rancid. While FDA-approved, the **National Toxicology Program** classifies BHA as "reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen."

## Context Matters

A preservative in a **life-saving medicine** is non-negotiable.
A preservative in a **fresh salad** is suspicious.

The goal isn't "zero preservatives"—that often leads to massive food waste or dangerous bacterial growth. The goal is *minimal effective preservation*.

## How to Check

Don't memorize the periodic table. Use tools.
The Untainted engine flags "High Risk" additives automatically based on the latest toxicity reports from the EFSA and FDA.
